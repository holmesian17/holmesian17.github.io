        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p class="first">My name is Ian Holmes and I am a graduate student in library and information science at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, MN. My focus is on public libraries, but I have also worked in a museum and a special collection at a medical library. I am interested in how libraries can be agents of change within their communities, advancing the use of technology in the library, and helping people who are in difficult situations.</p>
            <p class="second">It is my belief that the public library exists to serve all people regardless of age, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, legal status, ability, financial standing, or religious beliefs. In this vein, library policy should be written to enable patron use of everything that the library has to offer regardless of any of the above.</p>
            <p class="third">This website is designed to highlight work that I'm doing in school and in the public library as well as provide a space for my thoughts on libraries. Outside of the library world, I bike, play golf, read, and enjoy exploring new places.</p>
